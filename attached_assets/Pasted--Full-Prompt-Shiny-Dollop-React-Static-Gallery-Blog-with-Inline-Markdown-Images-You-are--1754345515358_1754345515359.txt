### 📌 Full Prompt: Shiny Dollop – React Static Gallery Blog with Inline Markdown Images

You are a senior frontend engineer. Build a fast, static image gallery blog called **“Shiny Dollop”** using **React + Vite**. The blog showcases curated photo albums using `index.md` Markdown files only — all images must be **referenced or embedded directly inside the Markdown**. Each post lives in a structured folder under `data/<model>/<slug>/`.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + `@tailwindcss/typography`
- **Markdown Engine**: `gray-matter` + `remark` + `rehype`
- **Routing**: React Router (or File-based via Vite plugins)
- **Search**: Fuse.js or Pagefind
- **Hosting**: Vercel/Netlify-ready

### 📁 Folder Structure (Organized by Model)

```
data/
  mila/
    wild-flower/
      index.md       ← contains all metadata + image links
    summer-bliss/
      index.md
  lena/
    golden-dreams/
      index.md
```

Each folder contains **only `index.md`**. Images are embedded using relative paths (e.g., `![01](./01.jpg)`) or `base64` if embedding raw.

Golden hour never looked better.

```

✅ All post content and images live inside this one file (`index.md`), and are kept together in their own folder.
